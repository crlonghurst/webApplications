          You can have 
            functionName.call(params) 
            to have that function invoked. To use a function call like this 
            you will need to have the first parameter being NULL or use 'this'
            to allow for data manipulation.

            You can add a description property to functions to allow for better
            understanding of what the function does.
            
            If a certain function takes a while to compute you can 
            cache or Memoization to allow for the value to be stored
            and used again at another time. This is only useful when
            you call the same function with the same argument expecting
            the same result.

            The cache object will get stored so that it looks like an array
            when being accessed.

            Immediately Invoked Function Expressions or IIFE pronounced iffy.
            This function type is immediately executed when defined.
            To make a function an iffy you simply do as the follows:
                    (function sayHi(){console.log("Hello");})();
            
            There is no way to remove a variable from a scope once it has been declared. 
            Be careful to only declare only the variables that are absolutely necessary.

            IIFE can be used to initialize code, meaning this code will only be run once
            like to initialize different objects a good example is:
                (function() {
                    const name = 'Peter Parker';
                    const days = ['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday',
                    'Friday', 'Saturday'];
                    const date = new Date(), today = days[date.getDay()];
                    console.log('Welcome back ${name}. Today is ${today}');
                })();
                Console output
                << 'Welcome back Peter Parker. Today is Tuesday'

            It is recommended to only use Strict mode inside of a IIFE function.
            Such as:
                (function(){
                    'use strict';
                })();
            This ensures only the IIFE function will use strict mode.

            An IIFE can also be used to create Self-contained Code Blocks. Such as
                (function () {
                    //block A
                    const name = 'Block A';
                    console.log(`Hello from ${name}`);
                }());
                (function(){
                    // block B 
                    const name = 'Block B';
                    console.log(`Hello from ${name}`);
                }());
            This will allow for two different code blocks to separated
            and also executed immediately after initialization.


            Because Javascript is dynamic you can call a function itself 
            but also define itself and also redefine itself. 
            Such as:
                function party(){
                    console.log('Wow this is amazing!');
                    party = function(){
                        consol.log('Been there, got the T-Shirt');
                    }
                }
            Javascript can be used to have asynchronous timing.
                function wait(message, callback, seconds){
                    setTimeout(callback, seconds * 1000);
                    console.log(message);
                }
            
            Callback hell is the term used to refer to a tangled mess of code
            that can't be comprehend.

            Promises are when asynchronous operations are done at once.

            Javascript also can make Generator functions that create iterators that maintain the state
            of a value.

            AJAX is a way to pass information between a server and the client side. 
            simple AJAX is:
                const url = 'https:example.com/data';

                fetch(url)
                .then((response)=>{
                    if(response.ok){
                        return response;
                    }
                    throw Error(response.statusText);
                })
                .then( response => //do something with reponse )
                .catch( error => console.log('There was an error!'))

                AJAX can use JSON or other Response Objects
