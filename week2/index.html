                    Microsoft started a Dynamic HTML or DHTML at the time of netscape.
                    This allowed more interaction to happen in webpages.
                    Javascript started having subsidaries such as Node to allow
                    for server side applications.

                    Javascript has ben increasingly popular to create single page applications
                    such as survive.io and slither.io and others that allow people to 
                    run the program or game in a lot of circumstances without installing anything.

                    For the best program in the browser a Graceful Degradation approach needs to be applied.
                    Meaning that you design for modern browsers that run Javascript, then 
                    adapt to meet recently outdated browsers that don't run Javascript.
                    This will allow for the best web design as possible.

                    There is no need to add semicolons at the end of line because of Automatic semicolon insertion (ASI)
                    which is really cool.

                    Best practice to not use var best to use let or const. So that variables have block scope.

                    I have been wanting to make multidimensional arrays. you do that by
                        const coordinates = [[0,0], [1,1]]
                    There are also data structions in Javascript I think it is native.
