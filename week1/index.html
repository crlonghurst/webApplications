                    To have a user save a input with JavaScript use localStorage.
                    It seems very handy to be able to use that function. 
                    Potential Uses:
                        1. Simple text
                        2. Preferences
                        3. Details
                    
                    Having a paradigm shift is what makes web developing complicated.
                    The more things that are changing the harder it is to keep
                    up with things.
                    When desiging mobile first it gives more simple webpages.
                    "Start small and scale up" a very good thing to live by.
                    "Big to small" is not very easy to implement.
                    Smartphones are not a fad.

                    "It's really hard to design products by focus groups.
                    A lot of times, people don't know what they want until
                    you show it to them." - Steve Jobs

                    Web Developers need to know their users better than the user
                    knows themselves.

                    Only 9% of users stay if you don't supply immediately what they need.
                    Be quick the faster your website loads the better.
                    If you are to slow they weill leave.

                    Not everyone has a fast internet some people have slow internet,
                    need to make everything as fast as possible.

                    "The trouble with software is ... it sucks. That's not a nice thing
                    to say  ... but it is a fundamental truth. Software Companies -- you,
                    me, CIOs of multibillion-dollar companies...have learned to live with
                    mediocre software. We do not count on software to be intuitively 
                    easy to understand or work consistently. Instead, we make do."
                                                    - Stewart Alsop - Venture Capitalist
                    
                    The easier your software is to understand and use the more
                    your software will be used and the higher the satisfaction will be.
                    Reduce Cognitive Load of the User.
                    Reduce the number of steps in the process.
                    "End-users, not technologies, shape the market. Consequently marketers
                    need to stay abreast not only of technological developments but also 
                    of the way people respond to them." - Matt Haig

                    I don't know how to make an ad go behind the 
                    content like in the cruise ad example.
