            Normally Forms have been processed completely in the backend with languages
            such as PHP and Ruby. But lately it has been popular to process information
            with javascript in the frontend.

            There are form javascript functions that can get the form elements
            though it is not advised to use some of these functions because
            if you have the same name in an id or class it could mess up the data.

            Reset buttons are not great for usability. They are too easy to 
            delete data that makes the user re-enter everything.

            HTML 5 has given a new attribute called focus to allow the browser
            to focus on a specific element.

            there is a type = "password" to allow for better entering passwords and
            other secret information.

            On a submit button you can make it disabled until you enter the form correctly.

            Encapsulation: making the innerworkings of a object hidden to the end user
            except the essential functions.

            Polymorphism: allowing functions that will be repeated to share code with different
            objects and functions.

            Inheritance: Taking functionalities from one object and applying them into
            other objects as needed.

            Classes: a class is how to define a object.

            Constructor Functions: a function that is called when declaring a 
            new object in a function.

            Parentheses aren't required to initialize a new object using a Constructor
            method.

            Javascript has built-in constructor functions for Objects, Arrays and Functions


            Prototypal Inheritance: every class has properties that is shared with 
            every instance of the class.
            Can use class.prototype.method to get the prototype of the variable.
