                    When OOP is being done having object classes 2 ways to do it:
                        1st way:
                            user = {
                                sayHi: function(){
                                    alert("Hello");
                                }
                            };
                        
                        2nd way:
                            user = {
                                sayHi(){
                                    alert("Hello");
                                }
                            };
                    
                    Both ways do the same way. The second one is preferred.

                    When debugging and showing parts of an object you can do it in two ways
                        1st Way:
                            alert(user.name);

                        2nd Way:
                            alert(this.name);
                    Once again 2nd one is preferred, because it leads to less errors.
                    Also having this.variableName tends to look more modular.

                    Objects can be called by objectName.value or objectName['value']
                    both will work just fine.

                    Objects can be declared in a few ways to easy ways are 
                            const superHero = { name : name, realName: realName};

                            const superHero = {name, realName};
                    The second is only available if the variable you are attempting to 
                    set the object variable to has the same name.

                    The most common way of getting DOM elements is
                            document.getElementById('idName')
                    This allows the script to find any part of the dom if you are specific enough.
                    Legacy DOM is was known as DHTML.
                    Getting Elements by ID is the best way to make sure you get exactly what you are looking for.
                    querySelector is another way of using CSS selectors to find an DOM object.
                    jQuery is Javascript framework that allows for easier selecting of DOM elements.
                    With getting objects you can add attributes and take away attributes or change them.
                    As well you can change what is being said on the page itself.
                    Based on what is done in the Javascript you can completely add new html elements to 
                    allow for new items to happen on screen after the user does something.

                    this.num1 = +prompt('num1?', 0);
                    this.num2 = +prompt('num2?', 0);
                },

                sum(){
                    return "The sum of number 1 and 2 " + this.num1 + this.num2;
                },
                mul(){
                    return "The product of number 1 and 2 " + this.num1 * this.num2;
                }
            };
            calculator.read();
            alert(calculator.sum() );
            alert( calculator.mul() );
