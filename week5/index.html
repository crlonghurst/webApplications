            An exception is an error that can produce a value that allows the program
            to deal with the error.

            Exceptions also leave a stack trace to allow for method calls to point
            to where the error occured.

            If an error is produced but isn't enough to crash the program it is called
            a warning.

            JavaScript is fairly forgiving when dealing with errors. 

            Even if a program doesn't have a error to crash or even give unauthorized 
            access. There is the detail of giving bad data. As well as crashes there is
            Runtime and logic errors that the program still runs but doesn't tell the user
            and just has bad data.
            
            To overcome logic and runtime errors testing and debugging is extremely important
            According to SitePoint, "In production, a ninja programmer should try to make
            the code fail gracefully (although not completely silently)"

            ECMAScript 5 introduced a new mode called strict mode allowing for better
            error handling, by giving more errors, and voids some old features. 

            Not using this strict mode is also known as 'sloppy mode' probably 
            it means that you could have more bugs and logic and runtime errors
            that are not handled correctly.

            To use strict mode apply: 
                'use strict'; 
            on the first line of code.

            Test-driven Development

            This is the type of development where you create the debugging tests 
            before actually writing code, this allows for making sure the code will
            function appropriately easier.
            A possible workflow for Test-driven Development (TDD):
                1. Write tests (that initially fail)
                2. write code to pass the tests
                3. refactor the code
                4. Test refactored code
                5. write more tests for new features.
            This cycle is referred to as "red-green-refactor" cycle of TDD.

            TDD is best practice ddevelopment.

            There are testing frameworks which are:

                Jest created by Facebook, installed by NPM, by following command:
                    npm install -g jest
                
        </pre>
      </div>
      <div class="text-warning text-capitalize text-center">
        
      </div>
    </div>
    <script>
        function squareRoot(number){
            'use strict';
            if (number < 0){
                throw new RangeError("You can't find the square root of negative number");
            }
            return Math.sqrt(number);
        };
        test('square root of 4 is 2', ()=>{
            expect(squareroot(4)).toBe(2);
        });
    </script>
  </body>
